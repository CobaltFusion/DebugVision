In the context of software development, the concept of telemetry is often confused with logging. 
But logging is a tool used in the development process to diagnose errors and code flows, 
and it’s focused on the internal structure of a website, app, or another development project. 
Once a project is released, however, telemetry is what you’re looking for to enable automatic 
collection of data from real-world use. Telemetry is what makes it possible to collect all that
raw data that becomes valuable, actionable analytics.
